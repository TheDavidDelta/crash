## üíò How does it work?

Have you ever liked someone, but aren't sure if it's mutual?

With ***cr@sh***, you're able to secretly select your *crushes*, who will only know if they *crush* you too!

For that purpose, you can login with your social media account (currently available for *Twitter* & *Mastodon*) and *crush* a maximum of 3 of your *mutuals* (people you follow mutually).

It's important to notice that **this is not a flirting app**, but an app for verifying mutual love on someone you already befriend with.

For keeping the integrity of this purpose, there are some intentional limitations:
+ **Maximum of 3 *crushes* per account**: So no one's able to *crush* all his friends, expecting to find anyone's love, a dirty way of improving flirting.
+ **Minimum of 1 week before *uncrushing***: So no one's able to instantly *crush* and *uncrush* someone, just for checking if they *crushed* them.
